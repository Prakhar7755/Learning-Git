To clone a repository, make changes, and then merge them back, you would use the following Git commands:

1. **git clone [url]**: This command is used to clone (copy) a repository from an existing URL.

2. **cd [repository-name]**: This command is used to change the current directory to your newly cloned repository.

3. **git branch [branch-name]**: This command creates a new branch where you can make your changes.

4. **git checkout [branch-name]**: This command switches to your newly created branch.

5. **git add .**: This command stages all the changes you made.

6. **git commit -m "[commit message]"**: This command saves your changes with a message describing what was changed.

7. **git checkout master**: This command switches back to the master branch.

8. **git merge [branch-name]**: This command merges the changes made in your branch back into the master branch.

9. **git push origin master**: This command pushes the changes to the remote repository.

Remember to replace `[url]`, `[repository-name]`, `[branch-name]`, and `[commit message]` with your specific details. Also, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to push to the repository. If the repository is not yours, you may need to create a pull request to propose your changes to the original repository.
