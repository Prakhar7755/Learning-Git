To uninitialize a local Git repository, you need to remove the `.git` directory which is created when you initialize a Git repository with `git init`. This directory contains all the repository related data¹²³.

Here is the command you can use:

```bash
rm -rf .git
```

Please be aware that this action is irreversible and will permanently delete the entire history of your repository¹²³. So, make sure that this is really the repository you want to "uninitialize".

If you're using Windows, you might need to use the following command instead²:

```bash
rmdir /s .git
```

Or if you're using PowerShell²:

```bash
Remove-Item ".git" -Force -Recurse
```

These commands should be run in your Terminal/Command Line while inside your project directory³.
